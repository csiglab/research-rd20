# Impact Model

Certainly! Here's a list of components often included in models that assess the impact of science, with a focus on patents, technology transfer, spin-offs, research outputs, and training scientists:

1. **Patents**:
    - **Patent Pooling**: This involves the aggregation of patents from different entities to create a single licensing entity. Patent pools can facilitate technology transfer and innovation by reducing transaction costs and encouraging collaboration.
    - **Patent Transfers**: The transfer of patents from research institutions or individual inventors to commercial entities for further development, production, and commercialization.
2. **Spin-offs**:
    - **Spin-off Companies**: Creation of new companies (spin-offs) based on intellectual property or technologies developed through scientific research. These companies often commercialize research outcomes and innovations, contributing to economic growth and job creation.
    - **Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs)**: These offices within research institutions facilitate the commercialization of research outcomes by identifying patentable inventions, licensing intellectual property, and supporting the creation of spin-off companies.
3. **Research Outputs**:
    - **Publications**: Peer-reviewed research articles, conference papers, and other scholarly publications that disseminate scientific knowledge and findings to the broader academic community.
    - **Data Sets**: Shared data sets produced through scientific research, which can facilitate replication, verification, and further analysis by other researchers.
    - **Software and Tools**: Development of software, tools, algorithms, and computational models that enable scientific research and innovation.
4. **Training Scientists**:
    - **Graduate Programs**: Graduate education and training programs that prepare scientists, engineers, and researchers for careers in academia, industry, government, and other sectors.
    - **Postdoctoral Training**: Postdoctoral positions that provide early-career researchers with opportunities for further training, mentorship, and professional development.
    - **Continuing Education**: Lifelong learning programs and professional development opportunities that enable scientists to stay current with advances in their field and develop new skills.

These components contribute to the overall impact of scientific research by fostering innovation, knowledge dissemination, technology transfer, and human capital development. Evaluating the effectiveness of these mechanisms can provide insights into the broader societal and economic benefits of scientific endeavors.
