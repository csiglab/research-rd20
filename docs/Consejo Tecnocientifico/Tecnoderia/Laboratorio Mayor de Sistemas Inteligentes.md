## Minors

- **Machine Learning Labs**: These labs focus on developing algorithms and techniques that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Labs**: NLP labs specialize in developing algorithms and systems that enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
- **Computer Vision Labs**: These labs develop algorithms and systems that enable computers to analyze and interpret visual information from images or videos.
- **Robotics Labs**: Robotics labs focus on developing intelligent systems that can perceive their environment, plan actions, and interact with the physical world autonomously or semi-autonomously.
- **Multi-Agent Systems Labs**: Multi-Agent Systems labs focus on developing systems composed of multiple interacting agents that exhibit intelligent behavior, often inspired by biological or social systems.
- **Cognitive Computing Labs**: Cognitive computing labs focus on developing systems that simulate human-like intelligence, including reasoning, learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.
- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Labs**: HCI labs focus on developing intelligent systems that facilitate communication and interaction between humans and computers, often emphasizing usability and user experience.
- **Expert Systems Labs**: Expert Systems labs focus on developing systems that emulate the decision-making abilities of human experts in specific domains, often using rule-based reasoning and knowledge representation techniques.
- **Reinforcement Learning Labs**: These labs focus on developing algorithms and systems that enable agents to learn optimal behavior through interaction with their environment and feedback signals.
- **Intelligent Control Systems Labs**: These labs focus on developing systems autonomously controlling complex processes or systems, often using AI techniques to adapt and optimize control strategies.
- **Neural Engineering Labs**: Neural engineering labs focus on developing technologies that interface with the nervous system or mimic neural processing, often for applications in prosthetics, brain-computer interfaces, or neural implants.
- **Data Science Labs**: Data science labs focus on developing techniques and tools for extracting insights and knowledge from large and complex datasets, often employing machine learning and statistical analysis methods.

These are just a few examples of the types of Intelligent Systems labs. Each lab may have its own focus areas, research objectives, and methodologies, but they all aim to advance the development and understanding of intelligent systems.
