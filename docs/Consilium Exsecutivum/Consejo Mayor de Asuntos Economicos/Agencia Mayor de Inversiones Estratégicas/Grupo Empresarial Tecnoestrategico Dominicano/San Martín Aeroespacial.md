SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk in 2002, has expanded its operations beyond rocket launches to encompass a variety of business units. Here are some of SpaceX's key business units:

1. **Space Launch Services:** SpaceX's primary business unit is its space launch services, providing commercial satellite launches, cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station (ISS), and potential crewed missions in the future. This includes the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles.
2. **Starlink:** SpaceX's Starlink project aims to provide global satellite internet coverage using a constellation of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. This business unit involves the design, manufacturing, and deployment of thousands of small satellites and ground-based user terminals.
3. **Starship:** SpaceX's Starship is a next-generation spacecraft designed for missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. This business unit encompasses the development and testing of Starship prototypes, as well as potential future missions and commercial applications.
4. **Dragon:** SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft is used for cargo resupply missions to the ISS under NASA's Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) program. The Dragon business unit includes the manufacturing and operation of Dragon spacecraft for NASA and other customers.
5. **Satellite Manufacturing:** SpaceX has its own satellite manufacturing facility in Redmond, Washington, where it produces satellites for the Starlink constellation and potentially other customers in the future.
6. **SpaceX Services:** This business unit encompasses various services offered by SpaceX, including mission management, payload integration, and launch services for government and commercial customers.

These business units represent SpaceX's diverse portfolio of activities in the space industry, ranging from satellite launches and internet services to interplanetary exploration.
