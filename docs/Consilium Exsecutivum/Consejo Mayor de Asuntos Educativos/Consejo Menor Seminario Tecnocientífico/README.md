# Consejo Menor Seminario Tecnocientífico

> Teach, Think, Ask, Research, Share, Refine, Apply !!!

> Redesign the System using the VSM.

> The best young reserach trainig  system in the world.

> The ones that failed to maintains the standards of learning are out → and have to move the another seminary or the technical school → later they can take a **preparatory class**.

> 6 Years of Training.

> Training of young Reserchers → Research From Day One.

> Seminario de Jovenes Investigadores.

> Canteras de Cientificos e Ingenieros Investigadores.

> Expose → Explore →  Ask → Research.

> Espontaneidad inculta → Flexibilidad Preparada.

> Clase en que se reúne el profesor con los discípulos para realizar trabajos de investigación.

> Intern Students →  For Research Training in Science and Engeniering.

> Move students to general or technical education in case that they don’t meet the requirements.

## Goals

- Prepare Science & Engineering Reserchers
- ...

## Model

> Learn, Ask, Apply !!!

> Internados, Profesores Con PHD …

> We don't used the idiotic concept of Gifted Education; we identify potential, and nurture potetial, even for the one not that gifted we offer the oportity of the best trainig system in the world.

> **Research** from day one: Basic re-discovery; and eventually original and fronteir research.

> **Tutoring System**: Tutorial system, emphasis on critical thinking, and small class sizes.
It's characterized by intensive one-on-one or small-group teaching sessions called tutorials.
> 

> **Independent Learning**: The model encourages students to take responsibility for their learning, conducting extensive independent study and research in addition to attending lectures and tutorials.
> 

> **Flexibility and Depth**: Students have the freedom to explore their subjects in depth and pursue their intellectual interests through a wide range of courses and interdisciplinary study options.
> 

> **Differentiated Instruction**: Recognizing that students have diverse learning styles, abilities, and interests, effective science teaching models incorporate differentiated instruction to accommodate individual needs and preferences. This may include providing alternative explanations, offering varied learning activities, and adjusting the pace and complexity of instruction.

> Strong foundations develpoment: modelling, natural philosphy, metacognition,  mathematics, probability, computer science, and other modelling skills.

## Admision System

>  Merits: Entry: Exams + Interviews + Evaluation Period !!!
>  Stochasticty: Select 20 % based on bare minimums requirements.
